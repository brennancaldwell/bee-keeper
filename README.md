# Bee Keeper 🐝

Chrome extension for easy-access hints for NYT's Spelling Bee. Small project to learn about Chrome extension development, with a little Vite / TypeScript thrown in for good measure.

## Development

```
cd bk-app
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will run the project locally with some spectacularly dumb dummy data.
